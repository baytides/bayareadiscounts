# Bay Area Discounts

[BayAreaDiscounts.com](https://bayareadiscounts.com) is a community resource that lists free and low-cost programs across the San Francisco Bay Area — including benefits for youth, seniors, families, veterans, college students, nonprofit organizations, and anyone looking to save on everyday costs.

This project focuses on **verifiable**, **publicly accessible** discounts and services — especially those supported by:
- Benefit cards (EBT, Medi-Cal, CalFresh, WIC, etc.)
- Local public institutions (libraries, museums, transit)
- Public or nonprofit community programs

The goal: **Help the Bay Area do more while spending less.**
