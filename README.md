## 🚀 Quick Start

### Using the Static JSON API (Easiest)

Access all program data via our static JSON API:

```bash
# Get all programs
curl https://bayareadiscounts.com/api/programs.json

# Get categories
curl https://bayareadiscounts.com/api/categories.json

# Get a specific program
curl https://bayareadiscounts.com/api/programs/alameda-food-bank.json

# Run local server
bundle exec jekyll serve

# View at http://localhost:4000

### Regenerating the API

```bash
# After modifying YAML files in _data/programs/
node scripts/generate-api.js

# API files are generated in /api/ directory
```

## 🔒 Privacy & Transparency

- **No personal data, no cookies**: The site does not collect or store personal information and sets zero cookies.
- **Self-hosted Plausible (aggregate only)**: We use a self-hosted Plausible Analytics instance that records aggregate metrics (utm/source, country, browser, OS, visit counts) without IPs, cookies, or user identifiers.
- **Standardized UTMs for impact**: External program links include `utm_source=bayareadiscounts&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=directory` so program partners can see anonymous referral volume; no per-user tracking.
- **No compensation or paid placement**: We do not receive fees, commissions, or referral payments for any listings or links.
- **Security**: Cloudflare provides TLS and DDoS protection; hosting and API run on Azure.
