# 🔒 Security Implementation Complete!

## ✅ All Resources Secured

Your Bay Area Discounts infrastructure is now hardened against attacks and abuse. Here's what was implemented:

---

## 🎯 What Was Secured

### 1. API Management Gateway
**Problem**: APIs were publicly accessible without authentication  
**Solution**:
- ✅ **Subscription keys required** - No anonymous access
- ✅ **Rate limiting**: 10,000 requests/day per key
- ✅ **Security headers**: HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options
- ✅ **Request validation**: Content-Type enforcement for POST
- ✅ **Timeout protection**: 30-second max request time
- ✅ **Error sanitization**: No stack traces or internal details leaked
- ✅ **Strict CORS**: Only your domains allowed

**Impact**: Prevents API abuse, brute force attacks, and unauthorized access

---

### 2. Azure Key Vault
**Problem**: Publicly accessible secret storage  
**Solution**:
- ✅ **Network firewall**: Default deny, Azure Services only
- ✅ **Your IP allowlisted**: Management access from your machine
- ✅ **RBAC enabled**: Role-based access control
- ✅ **Managed identity**: No passwords needed

**Impact**: Secrets protected from external access

---

### 3. Azure Redis Cache
**Problem**: Cache accessible from internet  
**Solution**:
- ✅ **Firewall rules**: Azure Services only (0.0.0.0/32)
- ✅ **TLS 1.2+ required**: Encrypted connections
- ✅ **Non-SSL port disabled**: No unencrypted access

**Impact**: Cache data protected from eavesdropping

---

### 4. Azure Functions
**Problem**: Insecure protocols enabled  
**Solution**:
- ✅ **FTP disabled**: No file transfer protocol access
- ✅ **Remote debugging off**: No debug ports exposed
- ✅ **HTTPS-only**: All traffic encrypted
- ✅ **Managed identity**: Passwordless Azure service access

**Impact**: Reduces attack surface, prevents credential theft

---

### 5. Cosmos DB
**Problem**: Public network access enabled  
**Solution**:
- ✅ **Public access disabled**: Zero internet exposure
- ✅ **Azure Services only**: Firewall rules enforced
- ✅ **Managed identity auth**: No connection strings

**Impact**: Database isolated from external attacks

---

### 6. Static Web App
**Problem**: Missing security headers  
**Solution**:
- ✅ **Content Security Policy**: Prevents XSS attacks
- ✅ **X-Frame-Options: DENY**: Prevents clickjacking
- ✅ **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME sniffing
- ✅ **Referrer-Policy**: Protects privacy
- ✅ **Permissions-Policy**: Disables camera/microphone/location

**Impact**: Protects visitors from common web attacks

---

### 7. Azure Front Door
**Problem**: No DDoS protection  
**Solution**:
- ✅ **DDoS protection**: Layer 3/4 and 7 mitigation
- ✅ **HTTPS redirect**: Forced encryption
- ✅ **Health probes**: Automatic failover
- ✅ **Global CDN**: Distributed load

**Impact**: Site stays online during attacks

## 🔑 Your API Subscription Key

**For Website Use:**
```
Primary Key: cac137c0e27f43b0b8cdb356b75cb087
Subscription ID: bayareadiscounts-website
Daily Limit: 10,000 requests
```

**How to Use:**
```javascript
// Add to your website's API calls
fetch('https://bayareadiscounts-api.azure-api.net/programs', {
  headers: {
    'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': 'cac137c0e27f43b0b8cdb356b75cb087'
  }
})
```

**Note**: Store this key securely. You can regenerate it anytime if compromised.

## 🚨 Monitoring & Alerts

**Configured Alerts** (Email: steven@baytides.org):

1. **High Error Rate**
   - Triggers: >5 errors in 5 minutes
   - Could indicate: Attack or system failure

2. **High Database Usage**
   - Triggers: >1000 RUs in 5 minutes
   - Could indicate: Abuse or inefficiency

3. **Daily Quota Exceeded**
   - Triggers: API subscription hits 10,000 requests
   - Could indicate: Legitimate traffic spike or abuse

**Real-time Monitoring:**
- Application Insights: Request traces, errors, performance
- Front Door: DDoS attacks, traffic patterns
- API Management: Usage by subscription key

## 🛡️ What You're Protected Against

### Common Web Attacks (OWASP Top 10)
1. ✅ Broken Access Control - API keys required
2. ✅ Cryptographic Failures - TLS 1.2+ everywhere
3. ✅ Injection - Parameterized queries
4. ✅ Insecure Design - Defense in depth
5. ✅ Security Misconfiguration - All services hardened
6. ✅ Vulnerable Components - npm audit on builds
7. ✅ Authentication Failures - Managed identities
8. ✅ Software/Data Integrity - Audit logs enabled
9. ✅ Logging Failures - App Insights monitoring
10. ✅ SSRF - Network isolation

### Infrastructure Attacks

## 🔍 How to Verify Security

### Test 1: Try API Without Key (Should Fail)
```bash
curl https://bayareadiscounts-api.azure-api.net/programs
# Expected: 401 Unauthorized with "Missing subscription key"
```

### Test 2: Try API With Key (Should Work)
```bash
curl -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: cac137c0e27f43b0b8cdb356b75cb087" \
  https://bayareadiscounts-api.azure-api.net/programs
# Expected: 200 OK with program data
```

### Test 3: Check Security Headers
```bash
curl -I https://wonderful-coast-09041e01e.2.azurestaticapps.net
# Look for: X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, CSP headers
```

### Test 4: Verify HTTPS Redirect
```bash
curl -I http://bayareadiscounts-web-b9gzhvbpdedgc2hn.z02.azurefd.net
# Expected: 301/302 redirect to HTTPS
```
